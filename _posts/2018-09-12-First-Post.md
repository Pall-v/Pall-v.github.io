title: A Post!

This is my first blog, so as a test, here is an idea that I would like to develop into a longer blog post in the future.  It is based on some speculative thoughts about data journalism that have been prompted my some of the materials reviewed in the UBC Master of Data Science program courses which reveal an apparent trend to publicly identify unknown or secret authors by using data science.  I plan to discuss:
* How easy would it be for anonymous authors to fool the journalists?
* Could the journalists deploy more sophisticated methods that are more difficult to fool?
* Is this cat and mouse game already happening and will it be possible to use data science to observe an adaptive system?
